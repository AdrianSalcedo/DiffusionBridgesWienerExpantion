# DiffusionBridgesWienerExpantion
 In this repository, we include all code files to replicate our results
 
To reproduce the Geometric, Logistic and Protein Kinetic use
1.- run Propagator_BB to generate the propagator order 12 changing the correspond inital condition.
2.- After generating the CSV use My_main (into the GeometricBrownian folder) in R-lenguage changing the corresponding 
CSV name file and path to generate the bridges using Wiener approximation method.
